									I'm either a transgender woman or nonbinary. haven't decided yet, but it will probably depend on if i will be able to see myself as a woman or not. 
									when i first started thinking about my gender identity i did first wonder if i was nonbinary but later thought i'd mostly lean into femininity anyways and that trans woman would probably fit me better, and now (for ME PERSONALLY) i find thoughts of being nonbinary as more a way of coping with my own struggles of accepting what i actually think my identity is. 
									that all could change though, only time will tell.

												I'd say for the most part this is the computer that I use the most these days.
												I still visit my family a lot, and laptops are obviously very portable, so I just end up doing a lot of things on here anyways.
												I've been trying to use my server more to try and make the things I work on computer agnostic to help alleviate things somewhat, but I do still like using my laptop even when I'm at home.
												Laptops are just cool.

												I bought this used from eBay in 2024. I kind of wished I had shopped around a bit longer for a model with more RAM, but I make do. 
												The base M4 mini model is rather enticing, I must say, though I don't really know if I'll be upgrading any time soon. 
												I don't really do anything intensive with my Mac after setting up my server anyways, I mostly only use it for light tasks like web browsing, watching videos, or streaming games.
											</p>
											<p>
												It might be embarassing to say, but a LARGE reason I bought this was so that I could play Sonic Dream Team on Apple Arcade. 
												I do own an iPhone or iPad that I could have also used, but I like gaming on like an actual computer more, you know? 
												I do also like the ecosystem integrations, which is mainly the other reason why I now use this as my main desktop computer.

												This was my main computer for the longest time, since I first built it in 2019. 
												Nowadays that I use my Mac mini instead, this has now been relegated to primarily being my gaming computer, or ripping movies / CDs since it has a Blu-Ray drive.
												The way I tend to utilize my PC is by streaming games from Steam on to other devices, such as my Mac or Steam Deck.
											</p>
											<p>
												I find that, especially with everything being hooked up over ethernet, it works surprisingly well.
												I played the entirety of Act I of ULTRAKILL this way and I never felt any kind of noticeable input lag or anything like that.
												Though, I do need to work on it a bit more, adding more non-Steam games that I have downloaded so I can stream those games too.
												Sometimes I'll also just hook it straight up to my TV and play that way too. Did this a lot when I was ripping a lot of movies at the same time, since the movies are all in the living room with the TV anyways.
											</p>
											<p>
												One issue though, I'm still running Windows 10.
												I assume I can upgrade to 11 if I just enable TPM in my BIOS, but I'm also considering installing Linux instead.
												Windows 11 is like fine to use I guess, and I have an Education license so it should be a similar experience to Windows 11 Pro.
												I'm pretty sure that's what my work laptop is running and it's fine.
												But, I also feel like Microsoft is going to keep pushing more AI garbage into the operating system and I ain't about that, which is why I've been considering Linux instead.
												My main concern is game compatability since this is primarily for gaming, but most compatability issues are with like live service games with anti-cheat, and if I am playing those games, I'm probably doing it on my PS5 anyways to be able to play with my friends.
												Either way, I haven't decided what I want to do yet, even though that October 2025 deadline is approaching fast, at the time of writing (September 2025).

									<p>2x Toshiba N300 8TB hard drives running in SHR.</p>
									
									<p>
										Why did I get a Synology, and especially one of the weaker ones? Well, at the time I already had my Proxmox server up and running with a separate PC running as my NAS. 
										After I moved out and the boot drive on the NAS PC started to show a SMART warning (it was already from an old used PC anyways), and all of my data was being stored on a 1TB USB hard drive, I decided I wanted to upgrade.
										I thought it over and decided that I wanted something with a smaller footprint that was easy to just set up network shares with, because that's all I really needed.
									</p>
									<p>
										I already knew about Synology NASes and after seeing some of the DSM features, I decided I would go with one of those. 
										Since I already had a server that could run Docker and anything else, I didn't need anything "powerful", and with my budget at the time I settled on the 223j. 
										Maybe the real mistake I made was getting a 2 bay model instead of 4, but 9 months later (at the time of writing) I still haven't even filled it halfway, and trust me I've been putting plenty of stuff on there.
									</p>
									<p>
										I think my most utilized feature is Synology Photos because it's a nice and easy way to back up photos off my phone since that's what typically takes up the most amount of space on there. 
										I also like Synology Drive in the same way that I use Google Drive, primarily to write up documents about random things like routes for Dark Souls playthroughs or making lists of games that I want to... legally obtain... sometime later.
										I also have a lot of my media on there for Jellyfin (all ripped from my own legally obtained copies, of course), files that I just want to be able to access on multiple computers, and of course copies of my most important files.

									<p>Proxmox is pretty cool.</p>
									<p>Here's what I run on it:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Debian LXC running Jellyfin</li>
										<p>I built this server specifically to run Jellyfin with Intel Quick Sync hardware acceleration thanks to the i5-12400 processor.</p>
										<li>Alpine LXC running Gitea</li>
										<li>Alpine LXC running Ubooquity</li>
										<li>ALpine LXC running Visual Studio Code Server</li>
										<p>I'm using this to write this page right now.</p>
										<li>Debian VM running Docker</li>
										Here's what's currently on Docker:
										<ul>
											<li>Portainer</li>
											<li>Heimdall</li>
											<li>Gitea Act Runner</li>
											<li>itzg Minecraft Server</li>
											<p>TBH I barely use this because my friends play on console so if I want to do multiplayer I have to be on Bedrock anyways. Not that I care as much about the difference than the average Java player.</p>
										</ul>
										<li>Void VM for using Handbrake</li>
										<p>No particular reason for using Void, just felt like installing it and then decided to put it to use with Handbrake to re-encode my movie rips.</p>
										<li>Fedora VM for development</li>
										<p>
											This is what I used for development before setting up the VS Code Server, but I'll probably still use it every now and then for other things as well. 
											Whenever I want to use it I can just remote desktop into it from any other computer I'm currently using and get going, it's nice.
										</p>
										<li>Windows XP VM</li>
										<p>I have Sonic Schoolhouse installed on here because I couldn't get it running on Windows 10.</p>

					<p>Here's some other stuff I like in no particular order:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Analogue Pocket</li>
						<p>
							People say this is overrated, and I guess yeah if you just want to be able to emulate a ton of different consoles, there are absolutely more cost effective options. 
							But wow, the screen. It's just gorgeous to look at, and the customizable video options are very nice as well.
							I don't have a ton of cartridges, but obviously one of the big features of the device is being able to play those, which is nice because my DMG has a dying screen.
							I also got the adapter that allows Game Gear cartridges to be played, which is nice because I've bought a few Sonic Game Gear games without actually owning a Game Gear.
							Outside of cartridges, I've purposely kept the FPGA cores that I have installed on it to just handheld consoles because I think that just suits it.
							I have other ways of emulating other consoles anyways.
						</p>
						
						<li>Steam Deck</li>
						<p>
							I preordered one of these a few days after the initial announcement, and I'm really glad I did. I personally got the 256 GB model. 
							Alongside my Framework laptop, this almost always comes with me whenever I'm travelling somewhere.
							I use it to play a lot of less demanding games while I'm out, alongside emulating consoles that something like my Pocket or Vita can't handle.
							I also use it to stream games from my main gaming PC to my TV, using the JSAUX dock to hook it up with HDMI and Ethernet, and then using either using my wireless Xbox 1 controller or setting up a folding table if I want to use a keyboard and mouse with a USB extension cord.
							All in all, super happy with the device.
						</p>
						
						<li>Hiby Digital M300</li>
						<p>
							I use this for like all of my music listening purposes outside of when I'm just using my Airpods with my iPhone for convenience. 
							I don't like the button layout as much as I do the button layout on the R3 Pro Saber, but that mine stopped turning on and I wanted something with streaming capabilities. 
							Unfortunately, the R4 with it's better button layout and 4.4mm output came out like a month later. I'm only a little mad about it.
							My favorite headphone set is my Sennheiser HD6XX, and my favorite IEM is my Moondrop Blessing 2: Dusk.
						</p>

						<li>Canon T2i</li>
						<p>
							Grabbed this from eBay for a decent price. One way I've gotten cheaper lenses for it is by grabbing some older ones from antique stores and getting an adapter. 
							My favorite is a Vivitar Series 1 70-210mm lens. It's big and heavy and cool. I've taken some nice photos with it.
							I do also have the original 18-55mm kit lens, and a 24mm lens that I got as a Christmas gift. 
							They're nice because I can actually use autofocus with them.
						</p>

						<li>Canon Powershot SX720 HS</li>
						<p>
							I got this for pretty cheap at a garage sale. 
							It's fine, more portable than my DSLR. 
							Honestly, my phone is probably better, but I just like having dedicated devices for things. 
							It's more fun that way sometimes.
